\section{Question 2: Parameter Tuning}

We tuned parameters by utilizing the simulator and by add points to the visualization. For example, we visualized the point cloud latency forward prediction to help with tuning. We also used printouts while running the car to make sure that certain calculate values were aligned with expectations. Finally, we simply ran the car to check for performance and tuned it accordingly.
